# Calculator
This project contains a calculator that gets an input number from the user and applies the bellow formula to it. Assuming the given number is 38, the calculation will be:

As noted in this formula, the sign is intercalated. That means that the first one is making a sum, while the second is subtracting, and so on until it reaches the smallest expression possible. For that reason, I determined that the number entered by the user must be greater than or equal to 2, because other than that it wouldn't be possible to make this calculation. Therefore, I created an if statement to make this validation, and if the result is false the program simply ends with the message: "Invalid number!".

Well, to perform this calculation, initially I created the following variables:
* **number**, to store the number entered by the user;
* **newSum**, to store the result of the calculation;
* **decimalFormat**, to store the format I wanted to apply to the values, with 4 decimal places after the comma;
* **read**, to read the input.

_Note: I used the name "newSum" because there is another variable I created further in the code, used to keep the previous result of the calculation._

After verifying if the number is greater than or equal to 2, I created the variable **j**, which is going to be used to store the initial value (the number entered by the user), and then it's going to be decremented with each iteration since the expression is getting reduced. On the other hand, there is the **i** variable, that gets incremented within the for loop, starting with 1 and going until it reaches the number given by the user minus 1. Therefore, the **i** variable is used as the divider of this formula, while controlling the number of iterations of the for loop.

As I want to display to the user each step of the calculation, I created the variable **currSum** inside the scope of the loop. In each iteration of the loop, this variable is going to store the current value of the total result before it changes again, in order to show to the user the previous value being calculated with the new value that was generated by the formula. I'm also going to show the expression used to calculate in each step, but I want it properly formatted to be displayed. The final result will be displayed using the format I created with the DecimalFormat class, so I'm going to apply this format to the expression as well. As for the variables **j** and **i**, they were declared as **double** to guarantee that the result will be as precise as possible. I don't want do display values like "38.0", since the user didn't type it that way, it would be weird. Therefore, I'm also adding a format to these numbers when they are being displayed, using the method **round()** of the Math class to round them. Then, the variables with the formatted values will be: **formattedExp**, **roundJ** and **roundI**.

Next, I put a 2 second pause because I want the information being displayed one by one instead of appearing all at once on the screen. Then, I display on the screen the formula being used and the result of this calculation.

For the sum, I use an if statement asking if the value of the **i** variable is equal to 1 or is an even number. I do this because the sign is only positive in one of these two conditions. Therefore, if one of these conditions are true, we enter the if scope where the result of the formula is being summed to the value of the variable **newSum**. To show it to the user, I also create variables in which there will be the formatted values of the previous result and the new result. Then, I display the calculation being made again. If it enters the else scope, I simply subtract instead of summing, and display the values the same way.
